## 📌 About Queue

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle.  
The first element inserted is the first one to be removed.

**Main Operations:**
- `enqueue()` → Add an element to the rear of the queue  
- `dequeue()` → Remove an element from the front of the queue  
- `peek()` → View the element at the front without removing it  
- `isEmpty()` → Check if the queue is empty  

💡 *Each implementation folder contains common functions and some different ones, but the core logic is the same.*
