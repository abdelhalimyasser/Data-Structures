## 📌 About Queue

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO** (First In, First Out) principle.  
The first element inserted is the first one to be removed.

**Main Operations:**
- `enqueue()` → Add an element to the rear of the queue
- `dequeue()` → Remove the element from the front of the queue
- `peek()` → View the front element without removing it
- `isEmpty()` → Check if the queue is empty
- `isFull()` → Check if the queue is full

💡 *Each implementation folder contains common functions and may include additional utilities, but the core FIFO logic is the same.*
