## 📌 About Stack

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle.  
The last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

**Main Operations:**
- `push()` → Add an element to the top of the stack  
- `pop()` → Remove the element from the top of the stack  
- `peek()` → View the top element without removing it  
- `isEmpty()` → Check if the stack is empty  

💡 *Each implementation folder contains common functions and some different ones, but the core logic is the same.*
